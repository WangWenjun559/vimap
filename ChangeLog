vimap changelog
=================

0.2.0 (2015-02-24)
 - Changed exception behavior so that zip_in_out() / imap_unordered()
   re-throw exceptions from workers. If an exception couldn't be properly
   serialized, then an alternate exception message is instead thrown.
 - Fixed the queue manager's total in-flight calculation, not sure how this
   will affect performance
 - (from 0.1.9): Better bounds on queue sizes, which is helpful for expensive
   input iterators

0.1.8-alpha-deadlock-quickfix (2014-07-31)
- Quick fix for a deadlock issue. See exceptions_test for the new test case.
  Some other issues make me want to investigate more before this branch is
  known to be stable.

0.1.7 (2014-04-24)
- Added VimapFold and FileRunner convenience classes to ext.
  This allows people to easily make vimap jobs that run over a bunch of files
  in parallel and fold the output together

0.1.6 (2014-03-26)
--------------------

- No longer specify testify in setup.py's install_requires. It is already
  in requirements-dev and this prevents testify/mock from being installed
  if you use vimap in production.

0.1.5 (2014-01-02)
--------------------

- Prints full exception tracebacks when workers fail
- Removed stringification of worker kwargs (this caused issues when passing
  large objects to workers, and was only done for debug purposes)
- Unit tests produce less console spam

0.1.4 (2013-12-11)
--------------------

- Better fix to clean up left-over FDs (cf. Github issue 14 and pull request 15)

0.1.3 (2013-12-03)
--------------------

- Automatic chunking, which only requires calling 'fork_chunked' in the place of 'fork'
- Added tests to ensure vimap is streaming, and big forks work

0.1.2 (2013-11-11)
--------------------

- Explicitly close queues from main thread
- Tracked down leaked FDs when shutting down pools
- Add Travis CI and make style conform to flake8
- Fixed setup.py to include the 'vimap.ext' package
