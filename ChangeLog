vimap changelog
=================

0.1.6 (2014-03-26)
--------------------

- No longer specify testify in setup.py's install_requires. It is already
  in requirements-dev and this prevents testify/mock from being installed
  if you use vimap in production.

0.1.5 (2014-01-02)
--------------------

- Prints full exception tracebacks when workers fail
- Removed stringification of worker kwargs (this caused issues when passing
  large objects to workers, and was only done for debug purposes)
- Unit tests produce less console spam

0.1.4 (2013-12-11)
--------------------

- Better fix to clean up left-over FDs (cf. Github issue 14 and pull request 15)

0.1.3 (2013-12-03)
--------------------

- Automatic chunking, which only requires calling 'fork_chunked' in the place of 'fork'
- Added tests to ensure vimap is streaming, and big forks work

0.1.2 (2013-11-11)
--------------------

- Explicitly close queues from main thread
- Tracked down leaked FDs when shutting down pools
- Add Travis CI and make style conform to flake8
- Fixed setup.py to include the 'vimap.ext' package
